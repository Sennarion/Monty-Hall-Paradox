What is the Monty Hall Problem?

Monty Hall asks you to choose one of three doors. One of the doors hides a prize and the other two doors have no prize. You state out loud which door you pick, but you don’t open it right away.

Monty opens one of the other two doors, and there is no prize behind it. At this moment, there are two closed doors, one of which you picked. The prize is behind one of the closed doors, but you don’t know which one.

Monty asks you, “Do you want to switch doors?”

The majority of people assume that both doors are equally like to have the prize. It appears like the door you chose has a 50/50 chance. Because there is no perceived reason to change, most stick with their initial choice.

Time to shatter this illusion with the truth! If you switch doors, you double your probability of winning!

What!?
